Just another social icons plugin, but with funky likes, followers, +1 counter and childishly simple configuration!

== Description ==

MRZ Social contains 2 widgets. One for displaying social icons (at this very moment 28 social networks to choose from) and another one for displaying likes, followers, +1 counter. All you have to do is provide URLs or e.g. Facebook page ID, MRZ Social do the rest for you. Simple as that!

There is no icon for your favorite social network? Tip me off and I'll see what I can do.
